## Radio modulation

At certain point of your life, you have probably stopped to observe behaviour of waves on a calm surface of a water. 

Imagine there is a bobbing object somewhere in the middle of that water. How are they moving? What is their amplitude? What happens to them as they move away from the source of bobbing? What is the distance between them?

Let's start with answering the questions, one by one.

* How are they moving?

If we have an object that is relatively small to water surface we are observing and it is impacting it at 90 degrees to the surface plane, we can expect that it will create circular waves.

* What is their amplitude?

If we think about it, the harder we move that bobbing object, the bigger waves are. So, amplitude of wave is in proportion to the amount of water displaced by object bobbing.

* What is the distance between them?

If we agree that wave is started each time we hit the surface of water, then, it makes sense to understand that distance depends on 2 things. First things is, how fast wave is travelling, second is, how often we impact the surface of water.
